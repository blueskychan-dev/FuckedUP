# About FuckedUP
* What is FuckedUP?

FuckedUP is software that allows you to BSOD windows without admin
Which is very helpful for Windows YTPMVs/Crazy Error/Development/Testing and more!

FuckedUP will work perfectly in Windows 8 or higher!

* How FuckedUP Work?

FuckedUP will use ntdll.dll to crash windows without admins!
By generate a hard system error in NtRaiseHardError() object.

We use same methods with MEMZ, but we don't overwrite MBR! (stay safe!)

<summary>More information from ChatGPT</summary>
<br>
  
The NtRaiseHardError function is an API function in the Windows operating system that is part of the native API provided by the "ntdll.dll" library. It is used to generate a hard system error, which can potentially result in a system crash (Blue Screen of Death or BSOD) or trigger other system-level error handling mechanisms.

The function takes several parameters, including the error status code, the number of parameters, a Unicode string parameter mask, a pointer to the parameters, a valid response option, and an output parameter for the response.

The primary purpose of NtRaiseHardError is to allow system-level components, such as drivers or system services, to report critical errors to the operating system. It provides a mechanism for signaling unrecoverable or severe errors that require immediate attention or system-wide notification.

It's worth noting that invoking NtRaiseHardError directly from user-mode applications is typically not recommended and should be done with caution. Generating hard errors intentionally can disrupt the normal operation of the system, potentially leading to system instability, data loss, or other undesirable consequences. Therefore, it should only be used for specific testing, debugging, or diagnostic purposes in controlled environments.

This message will gone after checked this box!

* Accelerate the FuckedUP process by spamming NtRaiseHardError

If you checked this box, FuckedUP will spam NtRaiseHardError process to make BSOD will happen faster!

Please Note Enabling this option may result in high CPU usage due to the creation of multiple threads by the process.
